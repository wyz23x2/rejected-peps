Welcome to Rejected-PEPs documentation!
=========================================

On June 13th, 2000, :pep:`1` came out, meaning most important language changes would be drafted into a PEP,
short for Python Enhancement Proposal. Some PEPs were `rejected, withdrawn`_ or deferred_ for different reasons.
This package picks up some of these PEPs and implements them.
